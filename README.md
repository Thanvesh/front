Product Management Application
Description
This project is a robust product management application built using React, Ant Design, and TypeScript/Javascript. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing products, including features for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting products.

Folder/File Structure
The project follows a typical React project structure:

Libraries Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Ant Design: UI library with a set of high-quality React components.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
React Router: Library for routing in React applications.
Axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
React Context API: State management solution for React applications.
Additional Notes
Pagination and sorting functionality have been implemented for efficient handling of large datasets.
Thorough form validation is provided for both adding and editing products, with clear error messages for the user.
Ant Design components have been customized to align with the project's branding and styling requirements.
The application is hosted on Netlify (https://master--product-managemnet-app.netlify.app/products).


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
